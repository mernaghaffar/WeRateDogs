WeRateDogs

WeRateDogsÂ is a hilarious twitter account that rates dogs by asking people to send photos of their dogs, then tweets selected photos rating with an amusing comment. 

Here I obtain data from three differents resources (file at hand, twitter API server and a file downloaded programmatically from Udacity servers). This is followed by an assessment then the data is cleaned.
